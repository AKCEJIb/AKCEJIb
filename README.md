## 🚀 About Me

I’m an ML/CV engineer and Python developer with 5+ years of experience building distributed computer vision systems and production-ready ML solutions for industrial applications. Skilled in designing microservices, training and integrating neural networks (CNN, RNN, DNN), automating data annotation pipelines, and deploying robust solutions at scale. I work at the intersection of reliability, precision, and scalability.

## 🔍 Projects Highlights

🚧 *(Most code is under NDA, so public work is limited. Below are conceptual summaries.)*

- **Industrial CV platform** with 100+ cameras across multiple factory sections. Achieved **91–95% mAP@0.5**, **<1% false positives**, processing data reliably at 1–2 fps using ML-enabled aggregation. Over 40 microservices deployed, scalable handling of hundreds of thousands of images per day with Kafka & REST APIs.

- **Railcar detection system** for harsh weather: track wagon movements, count units, robust to direction changes, integrated into customer infrastructure.

- **LPR (license plate recognition)** pipeline: YOLO → corner detector → LPRNet, end-to-end accuracy ~96%, reusable annotation converters, JSON-configured modular training system, TensorBoard logging, live deployments at various gates and checkpoints.
